# Runner Wrapper

`runner_wrapper/` turns a model repository into a SceneGenDeployBench runner image. It provides the HTTP server, job logging, resource measurements, Docker wiring, examples, and local test helper. A model repository normally only needs a model-specific `adapter.py` and runner catalog.

The directory `runner_wrapper/` is self-contained so it can be copied or pulled as a subtree without the main repository.

One runner catalog entry has one role:

- A generator turns dataset inputs into reusable generated files.
- An evaluator consumes dataset data and/or files from a generator and reports metrics.

## Add To A Model Repository

From the model repository root:

```bash
git remote add deploybench https://github.com/CashewHero/SceneGenDeployBench.git
git fetch deploybench subtree/runner_wrapper
git subtree add --prefix=runner_wrapper deploybench subtree/runner_wrapper --squash
```

Pull later updates with:

```bash
git fetch deploybench subtree/runner_wrapper
git subtree pull --prefix=runner_wrapper deploybench subtree/runner_wrapper --squash
```

The main files are:

```text
runner_wrapper/
  adapter.py       model-specific job implementation
  files.py         compatible artifact publication
  server.py        shared HTTP runner server
  Dockerfile       runner image build
  localtest.sh     local build and smoke helper
  AGENTS.md        detailed adaptation contract
  examples/        request, catalog, Docker, and workflow templates
```

Copy the matching catalog template to `runner_wrapper/config/runners/<runner>.yaml` and edit it for the model. To use the runner locally, copy that catalog into the active DeployBench runner-config directory.

## Build And Test

Build from the model repository root:

```bash
docker build -f runner_wrapper/Dockerfile -t my-model-runner .
```

Or use the helper:

```bash
runner_wrapper/localtest.sh build
runner_wrapper/localtest.sh smoke
```

For Pano2Room, full smoke also needs the three checkpoint files mounted with `RUNNER_WEIGHTS_DIR`; the helper mounts it at `/data/model_cache/pano2room/checkpoints`. Stable Diffusion inpainting must either be available via `HF_TOKEN` or supplied as a container-visible local model path through `PANO2ROOM_HF_STABLE_DIFFUSION_MODEL`.

## Data Flow

The orchestrator supplies the selected dataset data to a runner. An evaluator can also receive generated files and additional dataset viewpoints. Each runner reports reusable outputs or metrics back to the orchestrator.

The wire contract is defined in [Runner API](docs/api.md). Use the wrapper filesystem helpers to publish job files.

## Publish An Image

Create the image workflow from the included template:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp runner_wrapper/examples/github-workflows/build-runner-image.yaml \
  .github/workflows/runner-image.yaml
```

The target repository should be named `SceneGenDeployBench-<model>`. The workflow derives the GHCR image name from the repository name.
